# Monte Carlo Volatility Simulation

Performs Monte Carlo simulation on hypothetical option (based on input parameters and option information).  Plots simulated Black-Scholes implied volatilities vs. option strike price for across different actual volatility ranges (plot_strikes).  Also plots average realized volatility and implied volatility over different days-to-expiration values (plot_dtes).

Running and inputs done through command prompt scripts and text files, respectively, because of verbal specification.  I personally would've used command line arguments.

Created according to spec for summer 2017 internship at Bell Curve Capital.
